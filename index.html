        <h2>Who we are</h2>
        <p>
          Northwest Firepits is not just a business - it's a bond of three best friends who found their shared passion in community and fellowship. We believe in togetherness, in sharing stories, laughter, and s'mores around a warm, inviting fire.
      </p>
      <p>
          Our journey started as a simple idea during one of our many backyard gatherings. The joy, connection, and tranquillity we experienced around our homemade firepit inspired us to spread this feeling to others. Thus, Northwest Firepits was born - a company dedicated to transforming backyards into warm havens for family and friends.
      </p>

          Join us, and let's ignite connections, one backyard at a time. <br> <br>
